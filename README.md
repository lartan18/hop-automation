# Hop automation

Makeshift solution to get an almost impossible score in the game "Hop - Endless hopper" by Limitless. Made in an evening, and is only made to work on my computer. If you get it to work on yours, the most important thing to know is that ctrl+shift+l is the hotkey to start and stop the program while it's running. 

The bot will press the right and left arrows when it detects colors that trigger the "new tile" sensor.
